<p class="p6"><span class="s1">So far, Iâ€™ve made it to page 77 of â€œStarting Out With Java - From Control Structures Through Objectsâ€. I have been underlining and making comments throughout. I have quite a ways to go, you could sayâ€¦as the textbook is 1126 pages long. But Iâ€™m not worried about the length. I plan to read it a second time so that I really internalize the vocabulary and the structures of Java. <br>
<br>
It feels like Iâ€™m back in college, and I love the feeling of learning. I forgot how much I enjoyed analytical endeavors such as this. <br>
<br>
On the HTML side of things, today I added margins, fonts and a few other simple style choices to the website. Huzzah!<br>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This year, I turned 30, had a son, and decided to completely pivot my career. Until now Iâ€™ve been working as a studio producer, live sound engineer, performer and luthier. Although I enjoy all of these things, I feel that Iâ€™ve reached my full potential in these areas, and I would like to further challenge my analytical side. <br>
<br>
As someone who grew up in the early stages of the internet, I enjoyed dabbling in HTML and CSS, but those skills became gradually less necessary as tools like SquareSpace and Wix were created. I chose to use these tools for efficiency and instant gratification, without realizing how much I missed coding. Itâ€™s a surprisingly nostalgic practice.<br>
<br>
My fatherâ€™s two passions were songwriting and writing software for Macs. My brother ended up with a Computer Science degree, so for whatever reason, I decided to differentiate myself by going into music instead. I love implementing the intricacies of jazz harmony into a complex arrangement, or mixing a 100-track song into a radio-ready production. But the industry is becoming more toxic, and I think itâ€™s time for me to step away.<br>
<br>
Iâ€™ve decided to teach myself Java, mostly because it is one of two tracks offered by our local coding bootcamp, Tech Elevator. So I will either teach myself in preparation for their fast-paced learning, or I will bypass the bootcamp altogether if I feel that teaching myself is effective enough. Iâ€™ve been told that the best way to learn a coding language is to create your own projects, so Iâ€™m making this entire website from scratch with HTML, CSS, and as much Java as I can squeeze into it. I plan to make other Java projects and link them here, and document the development of my website.<br>
